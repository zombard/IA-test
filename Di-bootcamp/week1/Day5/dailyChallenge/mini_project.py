# Mini-project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
# Rock-paper-scissors is an old game that can be played between two people. 
# You can read about it in wikipedia
# We will create a game for the user to play Rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
#     The user will input his/her move (rock/paper/scissors),
#     and the computer will select either rock, paper or scissors at random.
#     We will then compare the user’s move with the computer’s move, 
# and determine the results of the game:
#     The user won
#     The computer won (the user lost)
#     A draw (tie)
# We will print the outcome of each game: the user’s choice,
#  the computer’s choice, and the result.
# The user will be able to play again and again. 
# Once the user decides to exit the program, 
# we will print a summary of the outcomes of all the games: 
# how many times they won, lost or and tied the computer.
# Here’s some example output:

# Instructions

#     Create a new directory for the game. Inside it, create 2 files:
#         rock-paper-scissors.py – this will contain functions to show the main menu, 
# handle user’s input, and show the game summary before exiting.
#         game.py – this will contain a Game class which will have functions 
# to play a single game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer, 
# determine the game’s result, and return the result.



# Part II - rock-paper-scissors.py

#     rock-paper-scissors.py : create 3 functions
#         get_user_menu_choice() - this should display a simple menu, get the user’s choice (with data validation), and return the choice. No looping should occur here.
#         The possibles choices are : Play a new game or Show scores or Quit

#         print_results(results) – this should print the results of the games played. It should have a single parameter named results; which will be a dictionary of the results of the games played. It should display these results in a user-friendly way, and thank the user for playing.


#         Note: results should be in this form: {win: 2,loss: 4,draw: 3}. Bear in mind that this dictionary will need to be created and populated in some other part of our code, and passed in to the print_results function at the right time.

#         main() - the main function. It should take care of 3 things:
#             Displaying the menu repeatedly, until the user types in the value to exit the program: ‘x’ or ‘q’, whatever you decide. (Make use of the get_user_menu_choice function)

#             When the user chooses to play a game:
#                 Create a new Game object (see below), and call its play() function, receiving the result of the game that is returned.
#                 Remember the results of every game that is played.

#             When the user chooses to exit the program, call the print_results function in order to display a summary of all the games played.
