# Step 4: Compare the Numbers
    if user_number==random_number:
        print("you're lucky!")
    else:
        print("you haven't guessed")
        print(f"random number was {random_number}, your number is {user_number}")
#     If they are the same, print a success message. Otherwise, print a fail message and display both numbers.
# Step 5: Call the Function
#     Call the function with a number between 1 and 100.
# Expected Output:
# Success! (if the numbers match)
# Fail! Your number: 50, Random number: 23 (if they don't match)
random_100(67)

# of ‚ÄúI love Python‚Äù.
# Step 5: Call the Function with Default and Custom Values
#     Call make_shirt() to make a large shirt with the default message.
#     Call make_shirt() to make a medium shirt with the default message.
#     Call make_shirt() to make a shirt of any size with a different message.
make_shirt("large")
make_shirt("medium")
make_shirt("any","I'm a genius")
# Step 6 (Bonus): Keyword Arguments

#     Call make_shirt() using keyword arguments (e.g., make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")).


# Expected Output:

# The size of the shirt is large and the text is I love Python.
make_shirt(size="small", text="Custom message")

#     Handling seasons (Bonus)
# Step 1: Create the get_random_temp() Function
def get_random_temp():
    return random.uniform(-10,40)
#     Create a function called get_random_temp() that returns a random integer between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius.
# Step 2: Create the main() Function
def main():
    temperature=get_random_temp()
    print(f"the temperature right now is {temperature}")
    if temperature<0:
        print("Brrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today.")
    elif temperature<16:
        print("Quite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat.")
    elif temperature<23:
        print("Nice weather.")
    elif temperature<32:
        print("A bit warm, stay hydrated.")
    else:
        print("It‚Äôs really hot! Stay cool.")
main()
#     Create a function called main(). Inside this function:
#         Call get_random_temp() to get a random temperature.
#         Store the temperature in a variable and print a friendly message like:
#         ‚ÄúThe temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.‚Äù
# Step 3: Provide Temperature-Based Advice

#     Inside main(), provide advice based on the temperature:
#         Below 0¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúBrrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today.‚Äù
#         Between 0¬∞C and 16¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúQuite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat.‚Äù
#         Between 16¬∞C and 23¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúNice weather.‚Äù
#         Between 24¬∞C and 32¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúA bit warm, stay hydrated.‚Äù
#         Between 32¬∞C and 40¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hot! Stay cool.‚Äù
# Step 4: Floating-Point Temperatures (Bonus)
#     Modify get_random_temp() to return a random floating-point number using random.uniform() 
# for more accurate temperature values.

# Step 5: Month-Based Seasons (Bonus)

#     Instead of directly generating a random temperature, ask the user for a month (1-12) 
# and determine the season using if/elif conditions.
#         Modify get_random_temp() to return temperatures specific to each season.


# Expected Output:

# The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.
# It's really hot! Stay cool.
